      <!-- Main section is being wrapped as a grid, as trying to do flexboxes without the grid became confusing
            However, this is where I ran into the biggest difficulties in attempting to position everything as in
            the mockup, and would benefit from feedback in this regard 
            It is almost as if I am getting lost in all the containers and what points to what -->

          <div class="grid-item">After studying Computer Science and graduating from 
            college with a BS in Mathematics, my path took a bit of a turn into the field of social work and mental health,
            where I have worked for about 20 years, mostly as a psychotherapist. But through the pandemic (and lots of my own therapy),
            I have realized that this path is no longer suitable, so I am venturing (full circle) 
            into Coding bootcamp and returning to my left-brained roots, where there are 
            answers and truly solvable problems.<br>
            <i>And as I continue to learn more about myself (and computer programming), I will update this portfolio.</i>
